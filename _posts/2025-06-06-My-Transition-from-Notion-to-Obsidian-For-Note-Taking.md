Amount of [Obsidian](https://www.linkedin.com/company/obsidianmd/) notes (6000) I have taken in the last two years! Thanks @obsdmd  
for making my brain better and helping my PhD and managing everything. Here's my journey from Notion to Obsidian and finally to PowerPoint for note-taking.  
  
When I started my PhD in 2021, I began my note-taking journey with Notion. Initially, I took around 2,000 notes in Notion. While Notion offered a lot of features, I found it exhausting to manage amid all my research work. The complexity and maintenance required became overwhelming, and it started to take up a lot of my time. I realized that Notion wasn't the best fit for my needs, so I decided to make a switch.  
  
In April or May of 2022, I transitioned to Obsidian. Since then, I've taken around 6,000 notes. Each dot you see in the graph is a note. Obsidian has been fantastic for several reasons. Its simplicity and text-based format make it easy to use, and the linking feature allows me to connect notes and create an organized index, making it easy to find information. The quick search functionality is incredibly useful for retrieving notes quickly, which has been a game-changer for my productivity.  
  
One of the best moments was when I had to quickly find a note for a crucial meeting. With Obsidian's quick search, I found exactly what I needed in seconds.  
  
At the start of new projects, I use Obsidian to gather and organize basic knowledge. However, once I have enough foundational information and begin working on practical applications, I shift my focus. To document my daily results and progress, I use PowerPoint. This approach makes it easier to present my work during meetings and track my progress efficiently. By documenting daily results in PowerPoint, I can compile and present information without additional effort, which helps me stay organized and reduces pre-meeting stress.  
  
This system has significantly improved my work-life balance, allowing me to maintain productivity without sacrificing my well-being. I get to enjoy better sleep and a more balanced life. ðŸŒŸ  
  

Iâ€™ve shared this full journeyâ€”from Notion to Obsidianâ€”in a YouTube playlist. I walk through my real workflows, show how I organize everything, and even share some of my note-taking tips that saved my PhD sanity.
