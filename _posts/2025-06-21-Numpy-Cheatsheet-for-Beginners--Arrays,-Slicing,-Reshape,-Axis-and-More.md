When I first started learning data science and machine learning with Python, I kept bumping into Numpy. The documentation was solid but too dense for quick learning. I needed a clear, simple reference with code-first explanations. Thatâ€™s why I made this guideâ€”for people like me who just want to get things done and understand the basics quickly.

## Getting Started with Numpy

Numpy is a fast, memory-efficient library that enhances Python lists by supporting multi-dimensional arrays and matrix operations.

### Array Creation and Indexing

```python
import numpy as np

# One-dimensional array
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
a[0]     # 1
a[-1]    # 3
a[0:2]   # array([1, 2])

# Two-dimensional array
a2 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
a2.ndim  # 2

# Define data type
a3 = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.float64)
```

### Elementwise Operations

```python
a1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
a2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

a1 + a2  # array([5, 7, 9])
a2 - a1  # array([3, 3, 3])
a1 * a2  # array([4, 10, 18])
a1 / a2  # array([0.25, 0.4 , 0.5 ])
```

### Matrix Multiplication

```python
a3 = a2.transpose()
a1.dot(a3)
```

### Matrix Shape and Slicing

```python
a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
a.shape         # (3, 2)
a[0:2, 1]       # array([2, 4])
a[:, 1]         # array([2, 4, 6])
a.reshape(2, 3) # reshape to 2x3 matrix
```

## Axis Concept

Understanding axis is crucial:
- **axis=0** â†’ column-wise operation (down the rows)
- **axis=1** â†’ row-wise operation (across the columns)

## Numpy Methods Cheatsheet

### Array Generators

```python
np.arange(0, 10, 2)       # Like Python's range
np.zeros((3, 4))          # 3x4 matrix of zeros
np.ones((3, 4))           # 3x4 matrix of ones
np.eye(2)                 # 2x2 identity matrix
np.random.random((2, 2))  # 2x2 matrix with random values
np.linspace(0, 1, 5)      # Five values linearly spaced between 0 and 1
```

### Common Operations

```python
np.sqrt(a)         # Square root
np.std(a)          # Standard deviation
np.unique(a)       # Unique values
np.vstack((a, b))  # Vertical stack
np.hstack((a, b))  # Horizontal stack
```

### Object Methods

```python
a.ravel()          # Flatten array
a.min()            # Minimum value
a.max()            # Maximum value
a.sum(axis=0)      # Column-wise sum
a.sum(axis=1)      # Row-wise sum
a.transpose()      # Transpose
```

### Array Properties

```python
a.size        # Total number of elements
a.ndim        # Number of dimensions
a.dtype       # Data type
a.itemsize    # Size of each element in bytes
a.shape       # Tuple of row and column count
```

## Vectorized Operations

```python
a = np.arange(6).reshape(3, 2)
b = a > 3
c = a[b]      # Filter elements > 3
a[b] = -1     # Replace elements > 3 with -1
```

## Iteration with nditer

```python
a = np.arange(6).reshape(3, 2)

# Row-major (C-style)
for x in np.nditer(a, order='C'):
    print(x)

# Column-major (Fortran-style)
for x in np.nditer(a, order='F'):
    print(x)
```

## vstack vs hstack

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

np.vstack((a, b))
# Output: [[1 2 3], [4 5 6]]

np.hstack((a, b))
# Output: [1 2 3 4 5 6]
```

## Final Words

This cheatsheet isnâ€™t meant to cover every advanced Numpy feature, but itâ€™s built to give you a solid starting point. Bookmark it, refer to it, and play around with the code. Thatâ€™s how I learned Numpyâ€”and it worked.

If you found this helpful, consider sharing it with someone who's just getting started in Python or data science.

### ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m **Shuvangkar Das**, a power systems researcher with a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Clarkson University. I work at the intersection of power electronics, DER, IBR, and AI â€” building greener, smarter, and more stable grids. Currently, Iâ€™m a Research Engineer at EPRI (though everything I share here reflects my personal experience, not my employerâ€™s views).

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on real-world projects involving large scale EMT simulation and firmware development for  grid-forming and grid following inverter and reinforcement learning (RL). I also publish technical content and share hands-on insights with the goal of making complex ideas accessible to engineers and researchers.
