Over the last 10 years, Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time in power electronicsâ€”starting with my first inverter project in 2015. For the past three years, Iâ€™ve been working closely with EMT (Electromagnetic Transient) simulation tools to model inverter-based resources.

Thereâ€™s one question that comes up often, whether youâ€™re working in simulation or hardware:  
**How do you design the output LC filter of an inverter?**

Itâ€™s a small part of the overall system, but it has a big impact on performance. Getting it wrong can lead to high ripple, resonance, or even instability.

So, in this post, Iâ€™ll walk through the **exact steps** I follow to design the LC filter for invertersâ€”useful for both **EMT modeling** and **real-world hardware development**.


### Define Parameters and Assumptions
Before doing any math, let's clarify a few things.
**Key Parameters:**
- Inverter switching frequency, $f_{sw}$
- DC link voltage, $V_{dc}$
- AC output voltage line to line, $V_{ac(LL)}$
- For simplicity let's consider output is purely resistive of load resistor, $R$
**Assumptions**
- Inductor current ripple, $\Delta i_{p p_{-} \max } = 20\%$
- Filter resonance frequency, $f_r = \frac{f_{sw}}{10}$ is standard practice to avoid interaction with switching frequency


### Step-by-Step LC Filter Design
1. Calculate peak current 
$$I_{peak} = \sqrt{2} \frac{V_{ac(LN)}}{R} = \sqrt{2} \frac{V_{ac(LL)}}{R\times \sqrt{3}}$$
2. Calculate maximum ripple current for 20% current ripple
$$\Delta i_{p p_{-} \max } = 0.2 \times I_{peak}$$
3. Calculate inductor value
$$
L=\frac{V_{dc}}{8 \Delta i_{p p_{-} \max } f_{s w}}
$$
4. Calculate filter resonance frequency, one tenth of switching frequency, to make sure filter does not resonate with switching frequency
$$\omega=\frac{2 \pi f_{s w}}{10}$$
5. Calculate capacitor value using the resonance frequency
$$C=\frac{1}{L \omega^2}$$

### Final Notes
This calculation assumes a purely resistive load and does **not include damping**, which is essential in many practical designs to control resonance peaking. Iâ€™ll cover damping resistor design and more advanced scenarios (like LCL filters) in future tutorials.

Whether you're designing for an EMT simulator or building a real inverter, getting your LC filter right is foundationalâ€”and this method has worked well for me across both domains.

Hi, Iâ€™m **Shuvangkar Das**, a power systems researcher with a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Clarkson University. I work at the intersection of power electronics, DER, IBR, and AI â€” building greener, smarter, and more stable grids. Currently, Iâ€™m a Research Engineer at EPRI (though everything I share here reflects my personal experience, not my employerâ€™s views).

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on real-world projects involving large scale EMT simulation and firmware development for  grid-forming and grid following inverter and reinforcement learning (RL). I also publish technical content and share hands-on insights with the goal of making complex ideas accessible to engineers and researchers.
