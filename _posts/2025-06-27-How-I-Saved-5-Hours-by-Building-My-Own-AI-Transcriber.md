I recently had to write a report from a 1-hour-long seminar. I had slides and a recording‚Äîeverything I needed. Still, the thought of playing it back, pausing, rewinding, and writing notes felt like a 5‚Äì6 hour chore.

But instead of grinding through it, I spent **just one hour**.  
üí° **30 minutes to build a transcription script**  
üí° **30 minutes to edit the report using the transcript**

This is where **local AI automation** shines‚Äîand if you're a researcher, engineer, or obsessive note-taker like me, this post might just change your workflow.

## Why I Built a Local Transcription Setup

I‚Äôve always loved **automating repetitive tasks**. It‚Äôs not just about saving time‚Äîit‚Äôs about doing work _once_ and reusing it forever. As someone who takes notes extensively in **Obsidian**, I regularly capture content from YouTube videos, webinars, and Zoom lectures.

Why?

Because when I need to revisit a specific detail, I don't want to watch an entire video again. I want to **search my notes instantly**. That‚Äôs where transcription comes in.

## Why I Don‚Äôt Use Online Services
There are many transcription tools online, but most have one or more of the following issues:
- Limited to 30-minute videos
- Slow processing or queue times
- Paid subscriptions or hidden costs
- **Privacy risks**‚Äîespecially critical when dealing with internal or corporate resources

Most companies don‚Äôt allow uploading internal meetings to third-party servers. **Local transcription is the only option.** I‚Äôve even used this for missed seminars‚Äîtranscribing them and extracting key ideas in minutes.

## How to Set Up Local Video Transcription with Whisper

Let‚Äôs walk through the process to set up **Whisper**, OpenAI‚Äôs powerful transcription model, locally on your machine.

### Step 1: Create a Python Environment
First, create and activate a Conda environment:

```bash
conda create --name transcribe python=3.10
conda activate transcribe
```

---

### Step 2: Install Required Packages

Install Whisper and necessary tools:
```bash
pip install openai-whisper
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg
```

---

### Step 3: Verify Installation
Before using Whisper, make sure it's installed correctly:

```python
import whisper
import subprocess

try:
    subprocess.run(['ffmpeg', '-version'], capture_output=True, check=True)
    print("FFmpeg accessible from Python")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"FFmpeg issue: {e}")

try:
    model = whisper.load_model("tiny")
    print("‚úÖ Whisper model loaded successfully")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Whisper issue: {e}")
```

Expected Output:
```
FFmpeg accessible from Python 
Whisper model loaded successfully
```

## üìù Transcribe Your Video or Audio

Here‚Äôs the script I use to transcribe any video file and automatically save the output in a `.txt` file.

```python
import whisper
from pathlib import Path

VIDEO_PATH = r"..\Obsidian\01 Obsidian Getting Started\00 Obsidian Getting Started V2.mov"
MODEL_SIZE = "base"
LANGUAGE = None  # Set to "en", or leave None for auto-detect

def transcribe_video():
    model = whisper.load_model(MODEL_SIZE)
    print(f"Transcribing: {Path(VIDEO_PATH).name}")
    
    result = model.transcribe(VIDEO_PATH, language=LANGUAGE)
    
    output_path = Path(VIDEO_PATH).parent / f"{Path(VIDEO_PATH).stem}_transcription.txt"
    with open(output_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(result["text"])

    print(f"Saved to: {output_path}")
    print("\nPreview:\n", result["text"][:300], "...")
    return result["text"]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    transcribe_video()
```

## My Workflow: Whisper + Obsidian = Instant Knowledge

I save each transcription in Obsidian, link it with related notes, and build a searchable, permanent second brain. Now if someone asks what was discussed in a 90-minute session last year, I have the answer in seconds.

---

## Final Thoughts

This tiny setup has saved me **countless hours**‚Äîand it cost me **nothing**. No waiting. No cloud. Just **offline AI-powered transcription** on my own terms.

If you value your time, your data, and your productivity‚Äîbuild this once, and thank yourself every week.

### üëã About Me
Hi, I‚Äôm **Shuvangkar Das**, a power systems researcher with a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Clarkson University. I work at the intersection of power electronics, DER, IBR, and AI ‚Äî building greener, smarter, and more stable grids. Currently, I‚Äôm a Research Engineer at EPRI (though everything I share here reflects my personal experience, not my employer‚Äôs views).

Over the years, I‚Äôve worked on real-world projects involving large scale EMT simulation and firmware development for  grid-forming and grid following inverter and reinforcement learning (RL). I also publish technical content and share hands-on insights with the goal of making complex ideas accessible to engineers and researchers.
