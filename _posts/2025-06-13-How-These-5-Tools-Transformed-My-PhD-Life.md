Let me start with a question —  
Have you ever felt like 24 hours just aren't enough to juggle research papers, deadlines, notes, and emails?

Back in my PhD days, I did too.  
I’d wake up with to-do lists that only got longer, not shorter. Notes were scattered, references went missing, and writing papers felt like pushing a boulder uphill.

Until one day, I stumbled upon a few tools — not recommended by a professor, not from any fancy productivity guru — but through pure trial, error, and late-night YouTube rabbit holes.

I made a short reel on it two years ago: [Watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dS2m8xC78cY) — but today, I’ll go deeper.


Because what these tools did was _quietly change everything_.

> If you’re a student or researcher constantly asking,  
> _“How do I become more productive?”_  
> _“How do I write better, manage references, or take better notes?”_  
> — this is for you.

### 🔍 1. **Note-Taking: Obsidian over Notion**

Let’s be honest — Notion _looks_ pretty. But in the middle of a research sprint, I needed more than just pretty.

Obsidian gave me speed, simplicity, and power.  
I could link ideas like neurons in a brain, write distraction-free, and find anything in seconds.  
It became my second brain — storing 6,000+ notes, all searchable, all connected.  
Once I switched, I never looked back.

### 📚 2. **Reference Management: Zotero over Mendeley**

I used to dread bibliography formatting. Seriously.  
Then Zotero entered.

It’s like having a personal librarian who organizes everything _exactly_ how you want — APA, IEEE, you name it.  
It even auto-updates PDFs and integrates with Overleaf.  
Mendeley felt clunky in comparison. Zotero just worked.

Zotero is open-source, community-backed, and widely used by top academics. No hidden paywalls.

### ✍️ 3. **Paper Writing: Overleaf over Word**

MS Word? For scientific papers? Not anymore.

Overleaf is real-time LaTeX, with version control, collaboration, and auto-compiling.  
No more broken formatting, no more lost figures.  
I could invite my advisor to comment directly in the paper without emailing endless drafts.

_If you write scientific papers and don’t use Overleaf yet, you’re missing out._

### 💡 4. **Idea Capture: Google Keep over Obsidian**

For spontaneous ideas while walking or during meetings, Keep wins.

It’s light, voice-enabled, syncs across devices, and works offline.  
I dump ideas here and later process them into Obsidian.

🪄 _Tiny habit, big payoff:_ Capture every thought. Don’t rely on memory.

### 🌀 5. **Paraphrasing: ChatGPT over Quillbot**

This is where AI shines brightest.

I used Quillbot for a while, but it often missed the tone.  
ChatGPT? It understood context.  
Whether I needed to simplify a technical sentence or rewrite it for clarity — it felt like having a co-writer who _actually gets it_.

📌 _Bonus:_ It also helped me brainstorm titles, check tone, and even write rebuttal letters to reviewers.

### Final Thoughts

> These 5 tools didn’t just make me productive — they gave me _clarity_.  
> In the middle of thesis chaos, they gave me structure.  
> And when I finally completed my PhD, these tools were some of my best collaborators.

If you’re still relying only on traditional methods, stop.  
Open your toolkit. Experiment. Evolve.

**Because the right tools don’t just save time — they save your mind.** 🧠

### 👋 About Me
Hi, I’m **Shuvangkar Das**, a power systems researcher with a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Clarkson University. I work at the intersection of power electronics, DER, IBR, and AI — building greener, smarter, and more stable grids. Currently, I’m a Research Scientist at EPRI (though everything I share here reflects my personal experience, not my employer’s views).

Over the years, I’ve worked on real-world projects involving large scale EMT simulation and firmware development for  grid-forming and grid following inverter and reinforcement learning (RL). I also publish technical content and share hands-on insights with the goal of making complex ideas accessible to engineers and researchers.
