## Key Takeaways

- Folder-based note-taking systems in Obsidian become messy and hard to maintain over time
- A folderless system using index notes (MOCs) scales better and reduces friction
- The 10-category system organizes your entire life across work, personal, and hobby domains
- Connecting notes through links creates a navigable knowledge network
- Using Ctrl+O (Quick Switcher) helps find any note in seconds
- Smart attachment settings keep your vault clean

## Introduction

Everyone starts note-taking with high energy, but over time that energy fades. After conversations with 10+ PhD students and researchers, one thing became clear: folder-based Obsidian systems don't scale. In this guide, we'll build a simple, folderless Obsidian system from scratch—one you can maintain even on your most exhausted days. This is the exact system used to manage 7,000+ notes across research, work, life, and content creation.

## Why Folders Fail in Obsidian

Folders create a false sense of organization. As note volume grows, navigating nested folders becomes cumbersome. The mental overhead of deciding where a note belongs increases. In contrast, a folderless system relies on links and index notes, making it easier to find and connect related information.

## Building a Folderless System from Scratch

Start with a new vault in Obsidian. Choose a location that syncs across devices (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive). Name your vault something meaningful, like "Thinking System." The vault is simply a folder where Obsidian stores all notes and metadata.

## Using Index Notes (MOCs)

Instead of folders, use index notes (Map of Content) to organize topics. Create an index note for each major area of your life. For example:

- **Mock Home** — index for personal information (bio, contacts, etc.)
- **Mock Study** — index for learning materials (programming languages, research papers)
- **Mock Work** — index for professional projects and tasks

Each index note contains links to other notes. This creates a navigable network rather than a rigid hierarchy.

## The 10-Category System

Categorize your entire life into 10 broad categories. Examples:

1. Home (personal)
2. Study (learning)
3. Work (professional)
4. Hobby (projects)
5. ... (add others)

Each category becomes an index note prefixed with "Mock". This provides a high-level overview and quick access to related notes.

## Connecting Notes and Avoiding Orphans

Every note should be linked from at least one index note. This prevents orphan notes (notes with no incoming links). Use double square brackets `[[note name]]` to create links. For example, link your bio note to Mock Home.

## Finding Notes Quickly with Quick Switcher

Press `Ctrl+O` (or `Cmd+O` on Mac) to open the Quick Switcher. Start typing the note name to find it instantly. This eliminates the need for folder navigation.

## Keeping Your Vault Clean with Smart Attachment Settings

Configure Obsidian's attachment settings to automatically organize files. This prevents clutter in your root folder and keeps attachments linked to their respective notes.

## Conclusion / Final Thoughts

A folderless Obsidian system reduces friction, scales with your note volume, and makes navigation intuitive. Start small: create your first index note and link a few notes. Over time, expand your network. Remember, the goal is to maintain a sustainable system even on exhausted days.
