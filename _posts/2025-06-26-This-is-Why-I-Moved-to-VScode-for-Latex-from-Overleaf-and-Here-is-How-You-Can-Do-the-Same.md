excerpt: Tired of Overleaf delays and manual uploads? Hereâ€™s how I transformed my LaTeX workflow using VS Code for faster compilation, Zotero integration, and Git control.

At the beginning of my second year of PhD, my professor gave me a big task: prepare the final report for our project titled *"Real-Time Interconnection Studies and Control of New York Offshore Wind."*[^1]  This wasnâ€™t a short summary â€” it was a hundred-page technical report. Like many others, I began using Overleaf, thinking it was the best choice for LaTeX documents. And initially, it was smooth. But as the report grew, the cracks began to show.

## Why Overleaf Didn't Work for Me

### 1. Slow Compilation with Large Documents  
As my report reached dozens of pages, every small edit triggered a long wait â€” sometimes several minutes â€” just to compile. When you're trying to focus, that delay is a productivity killer.

### 2. Attachment Management is a Pain  
Every time I tweaked a figure â€” even a small label â€” I had to re-upload the image manually into Overleaf. That might seem trivial, but in a hundred-page technical report, it quickly becomes frustrating and repetitive.

### 3. Manual Reference Upload from Zotero  
I use Zotero for all my paper management and citation tracking. My workflow involves adding new papers to a Zotero subfolder and generating a BibTeX file. But each time I added a paper, I had to upload the BibTeX file again into Overleaf. It broke the automation I wanted and made citation management unnecessarily manual.

### 4. Lack of Modern UI Features  
I prefer dark themes for long working hours, and Overleaf doesnâ€™t support that. The interface feels outdated, lacks tab support, and isnâ€™t optimized for writing large, modular reports.

### 5. No Free Git Integration  
Version control is crucial, especially when collaborating. But Overleaf charges for Git integration. For a student, that felt unnecessary â€” particularly when free alternatives exist.

## My Workflow Transformation with VS Code + LaTeX

After a frustrating experience, I began exploring local LaTeX editors. TeXStudio was my first try, but it didnâ€™t feel modern or smooth. Then I discovered the power of **VS Code + LaTeX Workshop extension**. That completely changed my workflow and made everything 10x faster.

### 1. Instant Compilation  
Unlike Overleaf, compilation is blazing fast in VS Code â€” usually under a second. No more waiting to see changes.

### 2. Easy Figure Management  
All my figures are in a subfolder. When I update a figure, it automatically reflects in the report without any manual uploads. Thatâ€™s peace of mind.

### 3. Fully Automated Zotero Integration  
I configured my Zotero subfolder to automatically export BibTeX into my manuscript folder. Now, when I add a paper to Zotero, it updates the `.bib` file without me touching anything. I just copy the cite key, and thatâ€™s it.

### 4. Customizable UI  
With VS Code, I use a dark theme, multiple tabs, and font settings optimized for writing. Itâ€™s far easier on my eyes, especially during long writing sessions.

### 5. Seamless Git and GitHub Integration  
Since everything is local, I manage my manuscript versions with Git. I push to GitHub and collaborate with co-authors without paying extra. I can even review commit history, create branches for different versions, and merge changes â€” all inside VS Code.

### 6. Peace of Mind  
No delays. No repeated uploads. No formatting glitches. Just writing, compiling, and focusing on content.

## How to Set Up LaTeX in VS Code[^2]

Hereâ€™s what I did to replicate this setup:
### Step-by-Step Installation  
1. **Install LaTeX Workshop Extension** in VS Code  
2. Download and install **[MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/)**  
3. Download and install **[Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/)**  
4. Open your `.tex` file and press `Alt + Z` to enable **word wrap** â€” essential for readability

Thatâ€™s it. You now have a powerful, offline LaTeX environment optimized for speed, automation, and version control.

If you're a researcher, grad student, or engineer writing long technical documents and struggling with Overleaf, give VS Code a shot. It saved me hours and gave me control back over my writing process.
