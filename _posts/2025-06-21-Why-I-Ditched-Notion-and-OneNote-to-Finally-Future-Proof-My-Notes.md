title: Why I Ditched Notion and OneNote to Finally Future-Proof My Notes
permalink: how-to-future-proof-your-notes

excerpt: I had over 2,000 notes in Notion and hundreds more in OneNote â€” years of ideas, research, and personal projects. But one day, I realized something that changed how I think about note-taking forever. Here's why I got rid of them and what I use now to future-proof my entire knowledge base â€” no subscriptions, no cloud lock-in, and complete control.

Have you ever thought about it?

What would you do if Google suddenly went downâ€”just for an hour?

Most of our digital lives revolve around cloud-based tools. And when it comes to note-taking, things are no different. Almost every modern app stores your notes on someone else's serverâ€”and most of them run on a **subscription model**.

That creates two big problems:
1. You keep paying monthly, even if youâ€™re not actively using it.
2. If the server goes down or the company shuts down, **you lose access**â€”possibly when you need it most.

Now think deeper.

If youâ€™re a knowledge workerâ€”researcher, student, creator, engineerâ€”your most valuable asset isnâ€™t your laptop or job.  
Itâ€™s your **notes**.  
Your ideas.  
Your accumulated knowledge.

So the **real goal of note-taking** isn't just convenience.  
Itâ€™s **control**.

You want a system that:
- **You own** fully
- Can be accessed after 5, 10, or even 20 years
- Doesnâ€™t break if the internet is down
- Doesnâ€™t lock you in with proprietary formats

This is what we call: **Future-Proof Note-Taking**.

So the big question is:  
ðŸ‘‰ _Which note-taking tool is truly future-proof?_

### ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m **Shuvangkar Das**, a power systems researcher with a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Clarkson University. I work at the intersection of power electronics, DER, IBR, and AI â€” building greener, smarter, and more stable grids. Currently, Iâ€™m a Research Engineer at EPRI (though everything I share here reflects my personal experience, not my employerâ€™s views).

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on real-world projects involving large scale EMT simulation and firmware development for  grid-forming and grid following inverter and reinforcement learning (RL). I also publish technical content and share hands-on insights with the goal of making complex ideas accessible to engineers and researchers.
