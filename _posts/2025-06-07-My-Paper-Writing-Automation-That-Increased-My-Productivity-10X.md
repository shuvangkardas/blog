excerpt: You spend hours dragging figures into the right place in MS Word, tweaking captions, and praying your references donâ€™t break. Iâ€™ve been there. Many of us have. And thatâ€™s exactly why I decided to change everything about how I write research papers.

If you're a PhD student or researcher, you probably know this feeling:

You have the idea. Youâ€™ve done the experiments. Youâ€™re excited to write it up.

And thenâ€¦ you open Microsoft Word.

The formatting nightmare begins.

You spend hours dragging figures into the right place, tweaking captions, and praying your references donâ€™t break. Iâ€™ve been there. Many of us have. And thatâ€™s exactly why I decided to change everything about how I write research papers.

Let me walk you through the journey that saved my sanity and doubled my writing productivity.

This is how I have written 8+ papers and my PhD dissertation in 2024. You can read about my 2024 high productivity [here]{% post_url 2025-06-05-How-I-Survived-Last-of-My-PhD-While-Doing-Internship-Whole-Year %}


### 1. The Microsoft Word Struggle
In the early days, I used Microsoft Word.  
Formatting figures? A nightmare.  
Citations? Always messy.  
Collaboration? Endless version conflicts.  
It was painful. It felt like I was working _against_ my tools.

### 2. Switching to Overleaf: My First Breakthrough
Overleaf was a breath of fresh air.  
I no longer had to fight formatting every 5 minutes.  
But I still had to manually upload figures, update BibTeX files, and manage referencesâ€”which wasnâ€™t ideal. 
I did not like the process uploading same figures hundred times when tweaking it for size, fonts etc.  Also, since, I use Zotero for reference management, hate that I have to upload bibtext every time, I add new reference.


### 3. Taking Full Control with Local VS Code +Zotero
I wanted an automated pipeline where I will add reference and changes figures and whatever I want to do all those sorts of things will be reflected instantly into my writing. 
That's when I build my vscode + zotero pipeline. 

I already have my Zotero setup very well. I made a ton of video on these in my YouTube channel. Next things is prepare vscode for latex support. Here is step by step guide for you. 


Thatâ€™s when everything changed.

I moved to **VS Code** with the **LaTeX Workshop extension** and installed:
**Install Latex on vscode**
1. Install Latex Workshop Extension 
2. Install miktex from https://miktex.org/
3. Install Strawberry Perl https://strawberryperl.com/
4. Enable word wrap in VS code when you open .tex file (Shortcut: `Alt+Z`). You have to do this every time, you open latex files to make life easier


I enabled word wrap (`Alt+Z`) and never looked back.

Now, I write, build, and update everything _locally_. No more cloud delays. No more uploading figures one by one, no more monthly charge on overleaf. Once I have written 200 pages report and Overleaf did not compile in free version because it was taking longer time. 

> This setup isnâ€™t just fasterâ€”it feels empowering. Like the tools finally work _with_ me, not against me.
