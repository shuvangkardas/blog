excerpt: Two months ago, I paid $130 in penalties for missing a rent payment by one day. But then I discovered a credit card that lets me pay rent with no fees—and even earns me points in the process. In this post, I share how I automated my rent, kept my 4% interest intact, and started earning rewards from my biggest monthly bill.

Two months back, I paid **$130 in penalties**—just because I was **one day late** paying my rent.
Here’s what happened.

I’ve been using **Fidelity Cash Management** as my main checking account. I love it. It gives me **4% interest** on my payroll deposits, no monthly fees, automatic overdraft protection, and a seamless way to manage all my spending and savings. I have written a 
[blog post]({% post_url 2025-06-17-I-Tried-5-Banks-as-a-Grad-Student—Only-One-Gave-Me-Peace-of-Mind-and-4.4%-APY %}) how it changed my finance and automate everything.


But… there was one problem.

My landlord uses a resident portal that **doesn’t accept Fidelity**. So every month, I had to **manually transfer money** to another bank just to pay my rent.

It sounds simple, but in reality? It was a recipe for mistakes.

Last time, I delayed the transfer by just a day. It crossed the 5th of the month—and I got hit with an **penalty**, which cost me $130. That was painful.

So I started digging. I asked myself:

> “Is there _any_ way I can automate rent payments—even when Fidelity doesn’t connect to my rent portal?”
> Also I want to set up Autopay, therefore, I do not need to worry about when salary hits my account

I love automating stuffs to reduce burden on me. At the end of the day I am a human and prone to mistake. Automation saves me. 
## 🔍 The Fix: A Credit Card That Pays Rent Without Fees

That’s when I discovered the **Bilt Mastercard**.

Here’s how it works:

- Bilt gives you a **bank account and routing number** you can use to **pay rent directly** in your resident portal—just like any checking account.
    
- It **charges zero transaction fees**, which is rare for rent-related credit card payments.
    
- And the best part?  
    You earn **1 point per $1** spent on rent.
    

Yes, that means I’m paying rent **and** earning rewards.

And since I route the rent payment **through Bilt**, my main Fidelity account remains untouched. I keep earning that **4% APY** on my balance, while my rent gets paid automatically.

It’s like a win-win-win.

## 💡 Pro Tip: How to Unlock the Rewards

There’s just **one rule** with the Bilt card:  
To earn rewards on rent, you must make **at least 5 transactions per month**.

So here’s what I do:
I set up **five small subscription payments** (like $2–$10) using the Bilt card—think Spotify, ChatGPT, Google Drive, etc. That’s it. Done. I meet the 5-transaction limit and unlock the reward for my rent payment effortlessly.

## 🎯 Redeeming the Points: What You Need to Know

The points I earn from rent payments are flexible:

- **Amazon**: ~$0.75 for every 100 points. Last time I used this. 
- **Hotels & Flights**: Often **more than $1** per 100 points I did not have chance to explore this option
- **Transfer partners**: If you're into travel hacking, Bilt has airline/hotel partners too
    

Sure, it’s not a ton of money—but it’s **free value on something I have to pay anyway**. And in personal finance, small wins compound over time.


## 🧠 Final Thoughts: Streamlining My Rent + Maximizing Rewards

So let’s recap:
- I avoided $130 rent penalties.
- I automated my rent payments using a credit card.
- I kept my 4% interest earnings with Fidelity untouched.
- I now earn travel and cash-equivalent points just for paying rent.


If your landlord doesn’t accept your favorite checking account—or if you want to **turn your biggest monthly expense into a rewarding habit**—this setup might be the fix you’ve been looking for.


I’ve personally been using the Bilt Mastercard to earn points on rent and travel—it’s been a great way to build rewards with no fees.
