It was 2022.  
I had just finished the first year of my PhD. But instead of feeling confident, I was drowning.

I was writing a research paper from scratch — no template, no direction, just a blank Overleaf page staring at me. My notes were scattered across PDFs, Notion pages, and sticky notes. Reference management felt like a nightmare. Every day was a struggle — I’d spend hours trying to recall where I had read a specific method or result.

And then, just when I thought things couldn’t get harder, our postdoc left suddenly. My professor handed me a major project — one that was completely out of scope and deadline-driven. Everything felt overwhelming. The chaos, the pressure, the cognitive load — I was burning out.

But then I picked up a book that changed everything:  
**Deep Work by Cal Newport.**

### The Book That Rewired My Brain

Newport defines _deep work_ as:

> “Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.” _(Location 32)_

Exactly what I needed — and exactly what I was missing.

I was doing everything… and nothing deeply. I was reacting, not thinking. Consuming, not creating. Every email, every Slack ping, every tab I kept open in Chrome chipped away at my focus.

One line hit me hard:

> “To remain valuable in our economy, you must master the art of quickly learning complicated things.” _(Location 145)_

That was my PhD in a sentence.

### From Chaos to Clarity: My Deep Work Transformation

After reading the book, I decided to flip my routine. Here’s what I did:

- **Blocked deep work hours** every morning: No emails, no meetings, no distractions. Just research, writing, and thinking.
    
- **Moved to Obsidian** for all my research notes. Linked ideas, backlinked thoughts. It became my second brain.
    
- **Automated my references** with Zotero + Better BibTeX. No more formatting chaos at the last minute.
    
- **Documented everything** I did, so I could do it once, and use it forever.
    

This one change — focusing on _depth over busyness_ — brought clarity.

Instead of solving a problem five times, I started solving it once, _properly_. Instead of juggling ten tabs, I’d deep dive into one paper. Instead of multitasking, I started mono-focusing.

I finally made progress. I finished my paper. Then another. Then more.  
By the end of the year, I had published multiple manuscripts and even led the big project successfully. All thanks to embracing _deep work_.

### Why Every Student (and Researcher) Needs Deep Work

> “Deep work is becoming a key currency.”  
> “It’s the superpower of the 21st century.” – Cal Newport

In an era of infinite distractions, your ability to focus — _truly focus_ — is rare. And that rarity makes it _valuable_.

Newport writes:

> “Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy:
> 
> 1. The ability to quickly master hard things.
>     
> 2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.”
>     

That’s what academia demands. That’s what research demands. That’s what _life_ demands.

### Final Thoughts: Deep Work Isn’t Just a Strategy. It’s a Mindset.

Looking back, 2022 was messy. But that mess led me to the mindset I carry today:  
🔒 Protect your focus.  
📚 Go deep.  
🧠 Master hard things.  
🛠️ Build systems, not just habits.

So, if you're struggling with research, learning, or creating in today’s noisy world — do yourself a favor.

**Read _Deep Work_. Then live it.**

### 👋 About Me
Hi, I’m **Shuvangkar Das**, a power systems researcher with a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Clarkson University. I work at the intersection of power electronics, DER, IBR, and AI — building greener, smarter, and more stable grids. Currently, I’m a Research Scientist at EPRI (though everything I share here reflects my personal experience, not my employer’s views).

Over the years, I’ve worked on real-world projects involving large scale EMT simulation and firmware development for  grid-forming and grid following inverter and reinforcement learning (RL). I also publish technical content and share hands-on insights with the goal of making complex ideas accessible to engineers and researchers.
