**Throwback to my first power electronics project — the one that sparked it all! ⚡**

Back in **2015**, I was a second-year undergrad with _no prior experience_ in power electronics or control systems. Still, I took on the challenge of building a **1kW pure sine wave inverter** from scratch.

With funding from **IEEE PES**, I dove into:  
🔧 PCB design  
🌀 Gate driver design  
🧠 Firmware development  
🔍 Signal testing and debugging

It wasn’t easy—I fried components, stared at gate signals for hours, and learned everything the hard way. But the satisfaction of watching it finally power up? _Unforgettable_.

To help others, I uploaded everything to GitHub. Even today, I still receive emails asking for the code and schematics:  
📂 GitHub: [github.com/shuvangkardas/pure-sine-wave-inverter](https://github.com/shuvangkardas/pure-sine-wave-inverter)

🎥 Fun fact: I uploaded the demo video on YouTube—and it now has **82K+ views**!

This project gave me a strong foundation in hardware, embedded systems, and problem-solving. Looking back, it's a powerful reminder of where the journey began—and how far it has come.

### 🚀 Hey! what's cool I'm doing now
I am making a very interesting video series on "smart personal knowledge management(SPKM)"". The idea is to make learning and knowledge-work easy and effective. Everybody does some form of knowledge work but most of the time does that inefficiently. As a result, despite working hard, we ended up with questionable results. I will address this problem in this course. So, do subscribe on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/ShuvangkarDas)
