Let me start with a proud moment.

On **March 30, 2025**, I successfully defended my PhD—completing it in just **3 years and 8 months**, with over **10 manuscripts** (some still in the pipeline). It wasn’t easy. I had my share of messy note files, forgotten ideas, and mental burnout.

But one thing saved me:  
**Building a Second Brain** — a system for organizing ideas, managing knowledge, and showing up every day with clarity.

During my PhD, I even created YouTube playlists sharing this process. You can check them out here:

And today, I want to share the **3 books** that quietly transformed how I took notes, learned deeply, and ultimately got published.

If you're a student, researcher, or lifelong learner—these books can change how you think, write, and grow.

## 📘 1. _Build Your Second Brain_ by Tiago Forte

> _Create a digital system for remembering everything and forgetting nothing._

This book gave me the blueprint for turning messy notes into a trusted system. Tiago Forte introduces the **CODE method** — Capture, Organize, Distill, Express — and shows how to build a workflow that scales with your mind.

### 🧠 On the Purpose of Note-Taking

> "Note-taking is a strategy for making information meaningful."

> "We take notes to remember information. An important part of remembering is understanding."

> "Note-taking is effective to the extent that you paraphrase, organize and make sense of the information while taking notes."

> "Taking notes is only effective if the student has sufficient note-taking skill to deal with the learning material."

### ✍️ On Active Learning and Memory

> "To use a strategy effectively you need to understand how it works... and your own learning style."

> "Research reveals the main value of note-taking is through its effect on how you encode the information in your brain."

> "The more anchor points you can connect to, the more meaningful the new information becomes, and the more easily you will remember it."

### 📚 On Reading and Preparation

> "Preparing your mind before reading a text is an important part of successful learning."

> "The first step in taking notes is not to read the text, but to prepare yourself for it."

### 🧩 On Understanding Through Connection

> "Making information meaningful is about connecting new information to existing knowledge."

> "Connection, not selection, is the heart of what makes information meaningful."

### 🗂️ On Summarizing and Condensing

> "A good summary: is short, contains only, and all, the most important information, and is in your own words."

> "Clearly the most difficult part of summarizing is to construct sentences that sum up a paragraph."

### 🔍 On Strategy and Skill Development

> "There is no one 'best' strategy for taking notes."

> "Research suggests that the most effective strategies are often those you are initially not most comfortable with."

## 📗 2. _How to Take Smart Notes_ by Sönke Ahrens

> _Master the Zettelkasten method and turn note-taking into a thinking process._

This book taught me the power of atomic notes and linking ideas. It’s not just about writing things down—it's about **thinking through writing**.

### Key Quotes:

> "We have to choose between feeling smarter or becoming smarter."

> "If you focus on understanding, you cannot help but learn. But if you focus on learning without understanding, you’ll fail both."

> "If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words."

> "That is why good, productive writing is based on good note-taking."

> "Things we understand are connected... and deliberately building these kinds of meaningful connections is what the slip-box is all about."

> "Even the best tool will not improve your productivity if you don’t change the routine it’s embedded in."

## 📙 3. _Effective Notetaking_ by Fiona McPherson

> _The science and strategy behind better notes, deeper learning, and stronger memory._

This book is a goldmine for cognitive insights — written by someone who really understands how the brain learns best.

### 🔍 Understanding Learning & Strategy

> “To use a strategy effectively you need to understand how it works.”

> “The most effective strategies are often those you are initially not most comfortable with.”

> “There is no one ‘best’ strategy for taking notes.”

### 🧠 Cognitive Science Insights

> “Working memory governs your ability to comprehend, plan, and organize.”

> “Our long-term memory is massive, but working memory is tiny.”

> “Working memory is about attention.”

### 📝 Note-Taking Principles

> “Note-taking is a strategy for making information meaningful.”

> “Taking notes is only effective if the student has sufficient skill.”

> “Reading actively often involves taking notes; taking notes often requires you to read.”

> “The first step in taking notes is not to read the text, but to prepare your mind.”

### ✂️ Summarizing & Processing

> “Distinguishing the important from the unimportant is arguably the most critical studying skill.”

> “If you can’t put it into words, it doesn’t count.”

### 🔗 Making Connections

> “Connection, not selection, is the heart of what makes information meaningful.”

> “The more anchor points you can connect to, the more easily you’ll remember the information.”

> “You can’t understand your material if you don’t make connections.”

### 🧩 Analogy, Comparison & Elaboration

> “Comparisons help learning by focusing on deeper structure.”

> “Analogies are worth seeking out — they’re powerful tools for understanding.”

> “Elaboration is how you connect new information to your existing mental database.”

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

These three books didn’t just help me write papers or pass exams.  
They taught me how to **think**, how to **retain**, and how to **create knowledge** from scratch.

If you’re overwhelmed by notes, struggling to recall what you read, or staring at a blank page while writing — start here.

📚 Build your second brain.  
✍️ Take notes that think with you.  
🧠 Make knowledge meaningful.

### 👋 About Me
Hi, I’m **Shuvangkar Das**, a power systems researcher with a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Clarkson University. I work at the intersection of power electronics, DER, IBR, and AI — building greener, smarter, and more stable grids. Currently, I’m a Research Scientist at EPRI (though everything I share here reflects my personal experience, not my employer’s views).

Over the years, I’ve worked on real-world projects involving large scale EMT simulation and firmware development for  grid-forming and grid following inverter and reinforcement learning (RL). I also publish technical content and share hands-on insights with the goal of making complex ideas accessible to engineers and researchers.
