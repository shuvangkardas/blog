excerpt: Don’t measure value by effort. Measure it by impact and usefulness to customer

Let me start with a story.  
(A story that completely changed how I think about _value_.)

A software company built a new product.  
An engineer—proud and eager—went to demo it to a customer.  
The customer asked,  
**“Can I export the data to Excel?”**

The engineer smiled. “Sure! Give me 10 minutes.”

He added the feature on the spot.  
Came back excited and told the CEO.  
But the CEO wasn’t impressed.

He said,

> “This is not about how easy it was.  
> That feature is _valuable_.  
> We could have charged $10,000 for it.”

That moment hit hard.  
And the lesson? It’s one I’m still learning every day:  
**Don’t measure value by effort. Measure it by impact and usefulness to customer**

As an engineer, I’ve found myself in this dilemma more times than I can count.

I often thought,  
“Oh, this is too trivial to matter.”  
Only to find out later that the _customer loved it_.

And sometimes, I spent _weeks_ on a project—polishing every detail—  
Only to discover no one really cares about it.

It’s humbling.

I’m slowly realizing:  
Just because something feels simple, doesn't mean it’s not valuable.  
And just because something is complex, doesn’t mean it’s useful.

The real skill?  
Putting ourselves in the **user’s shoes**.  
Seeing through their eyes.  
Feeling their pain points.

I’m not there yet. But I’m learning.  
And I hope one day, I’ll have that power—to perceive _real_ value before I even write a line of code.

If you’ve ever underestimated your own work or misunderstood what your user truly needed—  
You’re not alone.

Engineers like us… we build things.  
But understanding what’s _worth_ building? That’s a different game.
