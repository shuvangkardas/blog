After creating 6,000+ notes, completing my PhD, and helping hundreds of beginners through making YouTube videos, I noticed the same six pain points come up again and again. So, I built a solution, the **Free Obsidian Starter Kit**.

## 6 Beginner Pain Points in Obsidian
1. **Markdown Overload** – Many new users feel overwhelmed by syntax. It’s not hard, but it takes a bit of guided practice.
2. **Attachment Chaos** – By default, Obsidian dumps images in the root folder. The result? A messy vault where notes are buried under image files.
3. **Plugin Paralysis** – Obsidian’s strength is its plugin ecosystem, but the sheer number can paralyze beginners. Everyone’s vault starts to look like a developer's playground instead of a knowledge base.
4. **Syncing Confusion** – I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve been asked: _“How can I sync Obsidian for free?”_ The answer is simple, but often overlooked.
5. **Perfection Trap** – Seeing other people's beautifully crafted vaults can be demotivating. Don’t fall into the trap of building a perfect system before you even take a note.
6. **Setup Fatigue** – Customization is powerful, but only if you're not already exhausted before you start.


Here is everything you need to get started, no paywalls, no overwhelm.

## My 5 Golden Rules for Beginners
1. **Start simple.** Don’t chase perfection. Capture your thoughts first.
2. **Delay plugin exploration.** You don’t need 20 plugins to take smart notes.
3. **Learn basic Markdown.** Just the essentials. It pays off.
4. **Use simple sync.** Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive—pick one. Done.
5. **Understand Obsidian’s core purpose.** It’s not a team tool. It’s _your second brain_—a space for thinking, not collaborating with team.
