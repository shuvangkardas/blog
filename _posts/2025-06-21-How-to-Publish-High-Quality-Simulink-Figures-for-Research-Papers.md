If you're working on a thesis, research paper, or technical documentation, you‚Äôve likely struggled with making your Simulink plots publication-ready. I‚Äôve been there‚Äîfigures that looked fine on-screen turned blurry or misaligned when exported. In this tutorial, I‚Äôll walk you through the exact process I follow to edit and export Simulink figures from `.fig` format into clean, high-resolution images suitable for professional publishing. Whether you're a student or a researcher, this guide will save you hours of formatting and help your figures look polished and precise.


## Why Use `.fig` Format?
Simulink allows you to save figures in MATLAB‚Äôs native `.fig` format, which stores all properties of the plot‚Äîaxis labels, legends, line widths, colors, font sizes. This makes it much easier to update your figure without rerunning the entire simulation.


## Step-by-Step Plot Editing Workflow

### Step 1: Save Your Simulink Plot as `.fig`

After running your Simulink model, go to the plot window and - Save the Figure in `.fig` format 

This preserves the full object structure and makes the figure editable later.

### Step 2: Open and Edit the `.fig` File

Open the `.fig` file using MATLAB. Navigate to:

`Tools` ‚Üí `Edit Plot`

Now double-click on any plot element (axis, line, label). A property editor window will pop up.

### Step 3: Update Axis Colors and Properties
You can now:
- Change X and Y axis label color and font
- Adjust axis limits
- Add gridlines
- Customize tick marks

### Step 4: Change Line Width and Color
To enhance visibility, double-click on any line or signal and update its line width and color from the pop-up.

## Exporting the Figure for Publication
Once your figure is finalized, use the following script to export it in high resolution (300 DPI) and a specific image size.

```matlab
clear all; close all; clc;

fidName = 'Xfmr_LV_PhaseC_Current_Harmonics';
imageName = "2.3_Xfmr_LV_PhaseC_Current_Harmonics.png";

% Open the .fig file
fname = strcat(fidName,'.fig');
p1 = openfig(fname);

% Update Line Width
hline = findobj(gcf, 'type', 'line');
set(hline,'LineWidth',1.2)

% Set axis font size and grid
grid on;
set(gca,"FontSize",11);

% Set image size and resolution
imageWidth = 4.5;
imageHeight = 3;
imageDPI = '-r300';
imageFormat = '-dpng';

set(gcf,"Units","inches");
set(gcf,"position",[0,0,imageWidth,imageHeight])
print(imageName,imageFormat, imageDPI);

```

## Final Tips for High-Quality Figures
- Use consistent font sizes and line widths across all your figures.
- Always preview the final PNG or PDF before inserting into your paper.
- Stick to grayscale or color-blind-friendly palettes if publishing in print journals.
- Maintain 300 DPI or higher for professional publication.

### üëã About Me
Hi, I‚Äôm **Shuvangkar Das**, a power systems researcher with a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Clarkson University. I work at the intersection of power electronics, DER, IBR, and AI ‚Äî building greener, smarter, and more stable grids. Currently, I‚Äôm a Research Engineer at EPRI (though everything I share here reflects my personal experience, not my employer‚Äôs views).

Over the years, I‚Äôve worked on real-world projects involving large scale EMT simulation and firmware development for  grid-forming and grid following inverter and reinforcement learning (RL). I also publish technical content and share hands-on insights with the goal of making complex ideas accessible to engineers and researchers.
