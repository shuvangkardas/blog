excerpt: If you're version-controlling Simulink models using Git, youâ€™ve probably faced the frustration of binary file conflicts. In this post, I walk you through how I personally handle and resolve Simulink `.slx` file conflicts using Gitâ€”without relying on the built-in Simulink model browser.

In one of my [previous tutorials]({% post_url 2025-06-09-How-Do-Git-Source-Control-of-Simulink-Project %}), I explained how to set up version control for Simulink models using Git. But letâ€™s be honestâ€”once binary files like `.slx` or `.mlx` are involved, merging conflicts becomes a real headache.

Iâ€™ve dealt with this many times, especially during collaborative development where multiple team members push changes to the same Simulink model. Simulink does offer a graphical model comparison and merge tool, but I often find it clunky and unreliable for real conflict resolution.

So hereâ€™s how I personally handle Git conflicts in Simulink models step by step:

## Handling Binary File Conflicts in Git for Simulink

When Git encounters a conflict in binary files, it canâ€™t auto-merge them like it can with plain text. So you have to chooseâ€”whose version do you want to keep?

### 1. Identify the Conflicting File

In my case, the file Git flagged was:  
`Experimennt_RL/2024-07-28_PMSM_TD3/PMSM_TD3_Base/TrainTD3AgentForPMSMControlExample.mlx`

### 2. Choose Which Version to Keep

You typically have three choices:

- Keep **your local version**
    
- Accept **the remote version**
    
- Go back to **a specific commit**
    

### 3. Run Git Commands to Resolve the Conflict

**To keep your local version:**

```bash
git checkout --ours Experimennt_RL/2024-07-28_PMSM_TD3/PMSM_TD3_Base/TrainTD3AgentForPMSMControlExample.mlx
```

**To keep the remote version:**

```bash
git checkout --theirs Experimennt_RL/2024-07-28_PMSM_TD3/PMSM_TD3_Base/TrainTD3AgentForPMSMControlExample.mlx
```

**To go back to a previous commit version:**

First, find the commit hash:

```bash
git log Experimennt_RL/2024-07-28_PMSM_TD3/PMSM_TD3_Base/TrainTD3AgentForPMSMControlExample.mlx
```

Then check out the desired version:

```bash
git checkout [commit_hash] Experimennt_RL/2024-07-28_PMSM_TD3/PMSM_TD3_Base/TrainTD3AgentForPMSMControlExample.mlx
```

### 4. Mark the File as Resolved

Once you've decided which version to keep, run:

```bash
git add Experimennt_RL/2024-07-28_PMSM_TD3/PMSM_TD3_Base/TrainTD3AgentForPMSMControlExample.mlx
```

### 5. Complete the Merge

Now commit your changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Resolved binary file conflict in TrainTD3AgentForPMSMControlExample.mlx"
```

### 6. Push Your Final Changes

Finally, push your resolution to the remote branch:

```bash
git push origin master
```

In short, working with binary files in Git isn't ideal, but once you understand the workflow, you can resolve conflicts without panicking. Hope this helps anyone stuck resolving `.mlx` or `.slx` merge issuesâ€”been there too many times myself.

### ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m **Shuvangkar Das**, a power systems researcher with a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Clarkson University. I work at the intersection of power electronics, DER, IBR, and AI â€” building greener, smarter, and more stable grids. Currently, Iâ€™m a Research Engineer at EPRI (though everything I share here reflects my personal experience, not my employerâ€™s views).

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on real-world projects involving large scale EMT simulation and firmware development for  grid-forming and grid following inverter and reinforcement learning (RL). I also publish technical content and share hands-on insights with the goal of making complex ideas accessible to engineers and researchers.
