If you're just starting out in research and trying to generate high-quality figures for your paper, I want you to knowâ€”Iâ€™ve been exactly where you are. Early in my PhD, I struggled to create satisfactory visuals using **Microsoft Visio**. The figures looked fine on-screen, but once I exported them to PDF for LaTeX, they either had too much whitespace or an ugly black border.

This post is a guide for youâ€”and the version of me from a few years agoâ€”on how to export clean, high-quality vector graphics from Visio for research publications.

## Why Vector Graphics Matter in Research

Youâ€™ve probably noticed that images can be split into two main types:
- **Raster graphics** like JPEG or PNG, which are pixel-based
- **Vector graphics**, which are resolution-independent and scale perfectly at any zoom level

For research manuscripts, **vector graphics** are always preferred. Formats like **PDF**, **SVG**, or **EPS** preserve detail and clarity.

When I began writing my first PhD paper, I decided to export all figures in **PDF format** for three reasons:
1. PDF files open easily on any machine without needing extra software
2. LaTeX handles PDF images natively
3. The quality remains crisp no matter how much you zoom in


Butâ€¦ exporting PDFs from Visio introduced two major issues:
- Extra white space around the figure
- An unwanted black border

After several frustrating attempts, I finally figured it out.

## âœ… Fixing the White Space and Borders in Visio PDF Export

Hereâ€™s the exact step-by-step solution that works reliably.
### 1. Remove Extra Space Around the Figure
You want the drawing area to hug your content closely:
- Go to **Design â†’ Size â†’ Fit to Drawing**
This ensures there's no unnecessary padding around your diagram.

---
### 2. Eliminate White Borders

This part is a little hidden. Youâ€™ll need to **enable Developer Tools**:
1. Go to **Options â†’ Customize Ribbon**
2. Check **Developer** to add it to your menu
3. Click **Developer â†’ Show ShapeSheet**
4. Under **Print Properties**, set:
    - `PageLeftMargin`, `PageRightMargin`, `PageTopMargin`, `PageBottomMargin` to  0**
5. Go back to **Design â†’ Size â†’ Fit to Drawing**

Now your drawing will tightly fit the content, with no awkward white border.

### 3. Export Without the Black Border
Another sneaky setting:
- Go to **Export â†’ PDF â†’ Options**
- **Uncheck** the option:  
    `Document structure tags for accessibility`
- Choose:  
    `Current page only` and **do not include background**

Save the file.

## ðŸ§ª Sample LaTeX Code to Add the Figure

Here's the code I used to insert the cleaned-up Visio figure into my LaTeX manuscript:

```latex
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{graphic.pdf}
    \caption{Your figure caption} 
    \label{fig:graphic}
\end{figure}
```

Done. Your figure will now look professionalâ€”clean, crisp, and borderless.

## Final Thoughts

I searched for this solution longer than Iâ€™d like to admit. So if youâ€™re struggling with exporting publication-ready figures from Visio, I hope this helps you save time and frustration.
