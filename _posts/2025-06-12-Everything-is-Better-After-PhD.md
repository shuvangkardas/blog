> “Everything is better after a PhD”—one of my colleagues told me this, and honestly, I didn’t believe it at first. But now, I do. Here's why.

Hi, I’m **Shuvangkar Das**. I recently completed my PhD on **March 13, 2025**, and just before that—on **January 20th**—I started my full-time journey as a researcher.

It’s been a few months since then. And I can confidently say this:

> **My life is more balanced, productive, and joyful now than ever before.**

Let me take you through this transformation.

## The Final Stretch: Stressful but Worth It

In December 2024, I received my full-time offer.
That meant I had to join before finishing my dissertation or defense.

So, from January to March, I was working full-time **and** wrapping up my PhD.  
Yes, it was stressful. But I powered through—finalizing my results, defending my thesis on **March 30**, and finally walking across the stage at commencement on **May 8**.

That moment was surreal. It felt like a heavy weight had lifted.

## Life After PhD
### 1. A Balanced Routine I Never Had Before

Now my life is refreshingly structured.  
🕘 I go to the office 9–5  
🕖 Come home, cook a meal  
🎬 Watch a serial with my wife  
😴 Go to bed by 10 PM  
🌞 Wake up around 5–6 AM, feeling fully rested

That routine alone has done wonders for my physical and mental health.

### 2. Health Improvements I Didn’t Expect

Before, I was constantly sleep-deprived. Working under lab lights gave me headaches. I couldn’t focus for long hours.

Now?  
✅ I sleep 8 hours  
✅ No more headaches  
✅ Sharper focus at work  
✅ No burnout  
✅ I even lost 8–9 pounds in just one month

It’s amazing what rest and routine can do.

### 3. I Finally Have Time for My Hobbies

Thanks to early mornings, I get **2+ hours of uninterrupted time before work**.  
And here’s what I’ve done with that:

✍️ Published **25+ blog posts** in just one week  
📄 Reviewed research papers I submitted months ago  
🎥 Planning to **restart my YouTube channel** next month (I made an [Obsidian second-brain tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suvEVzeEKgc) back in 2022)

### 4. Working With the Best Minds in the World

At EPRI, I now collaborate with researchers from all over the world—experts in optimization, protection, distribution, transmission, and inverter systems.

Each day is a learning experience. I’m exposed to new ideas, tools, and systems. And I no longer stay stuck on problems for days like I used to during my PhD.

🙌 Need help? Someone’s always there to brainstorm with.  
📈 Result? I’m publishing **more research papers** than ever—thanks to these brilliant collaborations.

### 5. Travel, Food, and Fishing — The Bonus Life Perks

Another beautiful side of post-PhD life:  
🌍 Monthly travel for work  
🍱 Amazing food in new cities  
🎣 Weekend fishing trips  
🧳 Freedom to take leave and unwind whenever I need

It’s not just about career growth anymore. It’s about living fully.

### 👋 About Me
Hi, I’m **Shuvangkar Das**, a power systems researcher with a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Clarkson University. I work at the intersection of power electronics, DER, IBR, and AI — building greener, smarter, and more stable grids. Currently, I’m a Research Scientist at EPRI (though everything I share here reflects my personal experience, not my employer’s views).

Over the years, I’ve worked on real-world projects involving large scale EMT simulation and firmware development for  grid-forming and grid following inverter and reinforcement learning (RL). I also publish technical content and share hands-on insights with the goal of making complex ideas accessible to engineers and researchers.
