excerpt: Running multiple TensorBoard instances can be a game-changer when you're comparing models, tweaking hyperparameters, or just debugging deep learning pipelines. Here's how I run multiple logs in parallel using different ports ‚Äî a simple trick that helped me speed up my workflow and make better training decisions.

If you're deep into model training and experiment tracking like me, you've probably faced the need to monitor different runs side by side. At one point, I was juggling multiple folders of logs and manually switching directories, which felt clunky.

Eventually, I found a better way: **running multiple instances of TensorBoard** at the same time ‚Äî each on a different port. This small change made my debugging and comparison process much more efficient.

Here‚Äôs how I do it.

## Step-by-Step: Run Multiple TensorBoard Instances

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Open CMD in Your Project Folder

Make sure you‚Äôre inside the folder where your training script or log directory lives.

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Activate Your Conda Environment

```bash
conda activate your_env_name
```

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Launch TensorBoard

For the default log directory:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=logs
```

Or to run on a specific port (e.g., 6007):

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=logs --port=6007
```

## Running Two TensorBoard Instances in Parallel

Let‚Äôs say you have two different training runs, each saving logs in different folders. Here‚Äôs what to do:

### üñ•Ô∏è Terminal Window 1:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=path/to/first/logdir --port=6006
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Terminal Window 2:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=path/to/second/logdir --port=6007
```

### Access in Browser:

- Visit `http://localhost:6006` for the first instance.
    
- Visit `http://localhost:6007` for the second instance.

## Why This Helped Me

When I was tuning hyperparameters for a reinforcement learning project, comparing reward curves across multiple runs in one interface just wasn‚Äôt cutting it. By running parallel TensorBoard instances, I could visually scan and compare experiments without jumping between folders or restarting logs.

## Final Thoughts

If you're training deep learning models regularly, learning how to run multiple TensorBoard sessions is a productivity boost. It's one of those small things that pay off big over time.

### üëã About Me
Hi, I‚Äôm **Shuvangkar Das**, a power systems researcher with a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Clarkson University. I work at the intersection of power electronics, DER, IBR, and AI ‚Äî building greener, smarter, and more stable grids. Currently, I‚Äôm a Research Engineer at EPRI (though everything I share here reflects my personal experience, not my employer‚Äôs views).

Over the years, I‚Äôve worked on real-world projects involving large scale EMT simulation and firmware development for  grid-forming and grid following inverter and reinforcement learning (RL). I also publish technical content and share hands-on insights with the goal of making complex ideas accessible to engineers and researchers.
