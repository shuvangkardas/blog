If you're using Obsidian for research, notes, or writing papers, adding citations becomes essential. I often get asked:

> **‚ÄúHow do you manage citations in markdown inside Obsidian?‚Äù**
> ***"How to do you add citations in the markdown file"***
> ***How to add reference in obsidian notes?***
> ***What is the automated way to add reference or citation in obsidian?***

Let me walk you through three ways‚Äîstarting from the simplest to the most powerful automation I use every day to  add Citations in Obsidian (Simple + Automated Ways)

## ‚úÖ Method 1: Manual Footnote Citation

This is the most basic method. It works for short notes or quick references.

### Step-by-step:

1. At the point where you want to cite, add:
    ```
    This idea was inspired by Smith et al. ^[1]
    ```
2. Then, at the bottom of the note (or under a `## References` heading), add:
    ```markdown
    [^1]: Smith, J. (2020). *Understanding AI*. AI Press.
    ```
It‚Äôs simple but can get repetitive if you cite frequently.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Method 2: Fully Automated Citations Using Zotero + Plugin

If you deal with a lot of PDFs and academic papers, **Zotero is a must-have**.
### What I Do:
1. **Store PDFs in Zotero**  
    I organize all my research papers in Zotero. It manages metadata, tags, and more.
2. **Use the Obsidian Zotero Integration**
    - I use the  the [Citations Plugin](https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin).
    - Set up a BibTeX export from Zotero into Obsidian folder
    - Refer the BibTex to Citations Plugin
3. **Insert Citations with a Shortcut**  
    Once the plugin is configured, I can just type my predefined shortcut and pick the paper I want. It automatically generates citations and bibliography for me.
    
I even made a video showing the setup process:  

<iframe width="560" height="315" 
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sERXPJAT5KA" 
    frameborder="0" 
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
    allowfullscreen>
</iframe>

After setup, it feels like magic. I can reference any of my 500+ papers in seconds‚Äîno copy-pasting required.

## üîÅ Method 3: Semi-Automated Footnote with Shortcut

This bridges the gap between manual and fully automated.
### How It Works:
- I use the **Footnote Shortcut Plugin** in Obsidian.
- I configure a hotkey so when I press it, it creates a footnote block automatically.
- I then paste the reference inside.
It‚Äôs faster than manual, and works well when you don‚Äôt use Zotero or just want quick footnote-style citations.

## Final Thoughts
There‚Äôs no ‚Äúone right way‚Äù‚Äîit depends on your workflow.  
But if you're doing academic writing or managing lots of references:

> **Go for Zotero + Plugin**. It saves hours over time.

If you're writing casual notes or blog posts, the footnote method works just fine.
