## Key Takeaways

- **Folders can create decision paralysis** — deciding where each note belongs becomes harder as your vault grows.
- **Deeply nested folders turn note-finding into a treasure hunt** — after months, you forget where notes are.
- **Folders break single-source-of-truth** — a note cannot physically exist in two folders, forcing copies.
- **MOCs (Maps of Content) reduce friction** — they act as index notes that link to all related notes, eliminating folder decisions.
- **Tags are signals, not structure** — use them for discovery and filtering, not for primary organization.
- **You can combine approaches** — folders for high‑level separation, MOCs for navigation, tags for discoverability.

## Introduction

If you're starting with Obsidian, you've probably asked: *“Where should I put this note? Should it go into this folder or that folder? Should I use folders, no folders, PARA, Johnny Decimal, or tags?”*

This video answers that question in a practical way — not theory, not opinion, but a real system that actually works over time. I walk through three popular note‑organization methods used in Obsidian: folder‑based, folderless (MOC‑based), and tag‑based. Instead of telling you which one is “best,” I show you how each method behaves as your notes grow. You'll see why folders often create decision paralysis, why deeply nested folders turn note‑finding into a treasure hunt, and why folders make it hard to maintain a single source of truth.

Let’s dive in.

## Folder-Based Organization

Folders are the most familiar method because we’re used to them from file explorers. They provide a clear, visual separation of content. However, as your vault grows, folders can introduce significant mental friction.

### Problems with Folders

1. **Decision paralysis** — Where should a note about “how to read files in Python” go? Under a “Python basics” folder or under a “Python project” folder? If you need the same note in multiple contexts, folders force you to choose one location, breaking the single‑source‑of‑truth principle.

2. **Deep nesting creates treasure hunts** — After months, you might have a 30‑level deep hobby folder with nested subfolders. Finding a note becomes impossible. You end up asking, *“What exists? Where does it exist? Why does it exist?”*

3. **Copy‑pasting leads to duplicates** — To avoid moving notes, you might copy the same note into multiple folders. This creates multiple versions, making it hard to keep information consistent.

### Best Practices for Folders

- **Never go more than two levels deep**. Keep top‑level folders (e.g., “Work,” “Study,” “Home”) and second‑level subfolders (e.g., “Projects,” “Resources”). After that, place notes directly in the second‑level folder.
- **Use folders only when you don’t need connections**. If two topics are truly separate (e.g., “Templates” vs. “Journal”), a folder makes sense. But if they need to be linked, consider MOCs instead.
- **Navigate via shortcuts, not folder browsing**. Use Obsidian’s Quick Switcher (Ctrl/Cmd+O) to jump to notes instantly, regardless of folder location.

> **Pro tip:** Even with folders, you can still use MOCs and tags to improve discoverability. The key is to keep the folder structure shallow.

## Folderless (MOC‑Based) Organization

A folderless system relies entirely on **Maps of Content (MOCs)** — index notes that link to all related notes. Instead of asking “Which folder should this note go into?” you ask “Which MOC should I link this note from?”

### How MOCs Work

1. **Create an MOC for each major topic**. For example, an “MOC Investment” note lists all investment‑related notes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.).
2. **Link every new note to the relevant MOC**. When you learn about “macroeconomics,” you create a note and link it under the “MOC Investment” note.
3. **Navigate through MOCs**. Open the MOC, then click the link to the specific note. This eliminates the need for folders entirely.

### Managing Attachments

One downside of folderless systems is clutter: images and files appear alongside notes. You can solve this by setting a default attachment location in Obsidian’s settings. For example, set “Default location for new attachments” to a dedicated folder (e.g., “attachments”). This keeps your notes clean while still allowing links to media.

## Tag-Based Organization

Many users try to build their entire organization system around tags. However, tags are **signals, not structure**. They help with discovery and filtering, but they don’t replace the need for a logical structure (folders or MOCs).

### Tags as Signals

Use tags to answer simple questions like:
- “Show me all **courses**”
- “Show me all **stories**”
- “Show me all **tasks**”

For example, when reading the book *Deep Work*, you might tag notes with `#story` and `#code`. Clicking the `#code` tag filters all code‑related notes, making them instantly discoverable.

### Using Tags for Discovery

Tags work like social‑media hashtags: they group notes that share a common theme. This is powerful for future connections—you can later click a tag to see all notes about a topic and create new links between them.

> **Important:** Tags should not be your primary organization system. Use them alongside folders or MOCs to enhance discoverability.

## Combining Approaches

You don’t have to choose just one method. The video demonstrates a hybrid approach:

1. **Folders for high‑level separation** — Separate your vault into broad categories (e.g., “Legal,” “Finance,” “Personal”).
2. **MOCs for connection and navigation** — Inside each folder, create MOC notes that link to all related notes. This gives you a single entry point for each topic.
3. **Tags for discovery and filtering** — Add tags to notes to make them easy to find across the entire vault.

This combination gives you the best of all worlds: the clarity of folders, the connectivity of MOCs, and the filtering power of tags.

## Conclusion / Final Thoughts

Organizing notes in Obsidian doesn’t have to be overwhelming. The key is to choose a system that matches your workflow and scales over time. Start with one method (e.g., folderless MOCs), and gradually add folders or tags as your needs evolve.

Remember:
- **Folders** work well for true separation but can create friction.
- **MOCs** reduce decision fatigue and keep your knowledge connected.
- **Tags** are signals for discovery, not a replacement for structure.

The best system is the one you’ll actually use. Experiment, iterate, and find what works for you.
