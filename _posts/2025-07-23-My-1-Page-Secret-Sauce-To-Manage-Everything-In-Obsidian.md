"𝗡𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗳𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁" - 𝗝𝗶𝗺 𝗥𝗼𝗵𝗻
This is one of my favorite quotes. 
This quote sat on my desk when I was doing 
a full-time internship by day and PhD research at night last year.

It kept me grounded.  
Reminded me not to chase busywork.  
To focus on what actually matters.

I’m not perfect.  Still, I do lot of movements. 
But I try.

In this video, I shared something close to my heart.  
How I manage my blog, effortlessly.  
One simple note.  
One system.  
No burnout.

It’s not just for blogs.  
I use the same system to manage my research, YouTube, and all the little things in life that usually feel overwhelming.

If you ever feel pulled in 10 directions…  
This might help.

I hope it gives you a starting point.  
And a bit of calm.

### 👋 About Me
Hi, I’m **Shuvangkar Das** — a power systems researcher with a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, currently working as a Research Scientist. I work at the intersection of power electronics, inverter-based DERs (IBRs), and AI to help build smarter, greener, and more stable electric grids. 

My work spans large-scale EMT simulations, firmware development, reinforcement learning, and hardware prototyping. Beyond engineering, I’m also a [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/@ShuvangkarDas) and content creator — sharing hands-on insights on productivity, research, and knowledge management. My goal is simple: to make complex ideas more accessible and actionable for everyone.
