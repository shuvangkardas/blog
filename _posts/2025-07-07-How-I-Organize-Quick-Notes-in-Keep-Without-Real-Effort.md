It always starts the same.

I'm in the middle of a meeting, someone says something, and boom—a new idea sparks in my head.

Or worse... I’m out for a walk, enjoying the breeze, and suddenly my brain decides _now_ is the perfect time to solve a problem I’ve been stuck on for a week.

And just like that, the moment passes.  
Because I didn’t write it down.  
Because I had no frictionless place to store it.

Sound familiar? I guess  so!

That frustration pushed me to look for a simple, zero-barrier way to **capture thoughts on the go**—without overthinking, without opening ten apps, and without getting distracted.
### Fleeting Notes
Fleeting notes changed the game for me.

These are not polished thoughts. They’re not organized.  
They're not even meant to be permanent.

They are just quick brain dumps—snapshots of insight that your mind throws at you when you’re least prepared.

I’ve learned to catch them:
- During meetings (a flash of an idea? I write it instantly)
- During walks (I tell Google Assistant to take a note)
- While reading (underline a sentence? That’s a fleeting note in disguise)

And here’s the thing:  
I don’t _keep_ all of them.  
Once a fleeting note is processed—turned into a proper note, task, or discarded—I either delete it or archive it.
### But Where Do I Store Them?
Now here's the next pain point.  
People often say, “But if I take a _lot_ of notes, how do I _find_ anything later?”

Great question. I struggled too.

I tried fancy apps, Zettelkasten templates, even color-coded notebooks.  
Nothing worked quite like I wanted.

Eventually, I found my sweet spot: **Google Keep.**  
Lightweight, syncs across devices, opens instantly, even while walking.

But there’s a trick…
### The Simple `#Hashtag` Trick
To make your Keep notes findable, **add a `#` tag at the end of your note**.

Let’s say you had an idea about YouTube scripting.  
Just end the note with `#quote` or `#content`.

Later, when you search `#quote` in Keep—boom—all your fleeting notes related to that pop up.

No more hunting. No more forgetting.

**Real stories. Practical lessons. Right in your inbox.**  
No spam—just once a week.

### TL:DR
If your brain throws gold at you during random times, don’t lose it.
- Use a frictionless inbox (Google Keep is mine)
- Don’t worry about polishing—just _capture_
- Add `#` tags to make it searchable later
- And once processed, archive or delete

I no longer fear “losing” good ideas.  
I know they’ll be there, waiting for me, when I’m ready.

What’s your system for catching fleeting thoughts?
