# ðŸ§  My Second Brain â€” Notes That Turn Into Blogs

Welcome to my blog workspace!

I started building my **second brain** in 2021, during my first year as a Ph.D. student. Since then, Iâ€™ve taken over **6,000+ notes** in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), learning everything from **power systems, productivity, AI, note-taking**, and beyond.

> But hereâ€™s the twist â€” I donâ€™t just keep these notes to myself.

I turned my note vault into a **personal publishing pipeline**. With a single button press, my ideas go live â€” polished, precise, and straight from my second brain.

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Publish **500 blogs by the end of the year**  
ðŸ“š **Topics**: Productivity, Note-Taking, Power Systems, AI, Real-World Engineering  
ðŸš€ **Why it matters**: Writing no longer feels like a chore â€” it's part of my thinking process.
